        <h1>Pig-Dice Game</h1>
        <h2>How to play:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Player in turn rolls the die repeatedly (click "roll dice" button).</li>
          <li>
            The goal is to accumulate as many points as possible by adding up the numbers rolled on the
            die (displayed in "current" box).
          </li>
          <li>
            If a player rolls a "1", their turn is over and any points they have accumulated during this
            turn are lost.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rolling a "1" doesn't wipe out the player's entire score from previous turns, just the total
            earned during that particular roll.
          </li>
          <li>Each player's score is displayed under the player's title.</li>
          <li>
            A player can also choose to hold (click "hold" button) if they
            do not want to take a chance of rolling a "1" and losing all the points from their
            current turn. If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn are
            added to their score.
          </li>
          <li>
            The first player to reach a total of 100 or more points, wins the game.
          </li>
        </ul>
